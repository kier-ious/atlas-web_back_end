# Unit Testing Project

## Mocking
- What is Mocking?

Mocking is like using a stand-in or a double for parts of your code that are hard to test directly. Imagine you have a friend who helps you practice your soccer skills. When you practice a penalty kick, instead of using a real goalie, you use a dummy goalie. This dummy acts like a real goalie but is easier to control and use for practice.

In programming, mocking is when you create "fake" objects or functions to stand in for real ones. This is useful when the real ones are difficult to use in tests, such as when they depend on external systems (like a database or a web service).

## Parametrizations
- What is Parametrization?

Parametrization is like trying out different outfits before going to a party. You want to see which one looks best. In testing, it means running the same test with different inputs to make sure your code works correctly in various scenarios.

## Fixtures
- What are Fixtures?

Fixtures are like setting up the stage before a play. You arrange the props and set the scene so that everything is ready for the actors. In testing, fixtures set up a known state or environment before your tests run, ensuring that each test starts from the same place.

1. The Difference Between Unit and Integration Tests
Unit Tests:

- Focus on individual components or functions.
- Aim to test each part in isolation from the rest of the system.
- Typically fast to execute.

### Integration Tests:

- Focus on the interaction between components or systems.
- Aim to ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected.
- Can be slower as they might involve multiple parts of the application.
