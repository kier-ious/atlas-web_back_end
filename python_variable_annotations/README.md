# Python - Variable Annotations

## Description
Variable annotations in Python allow you to specify the type of variables, enhancing code readability and providing useful information for static analysis tools. Introduced in Python 3.6 as part of PEP 526, variable annotations enable developers to add type hints to variables without affecting runtime behavior. While Python is dynamically typed, variable annotations provide a way to indicate the expected types of variables in a clear and concise manner.

## Usage
To use variable annotations in your Python code:

Define variables with type annotations after the variable name using a colon (:) followed by the desired type.
python
Copy code
name: str = "John"
age: int = 30
Variable annotations can be used to specify the type of variables for better code documentation and maintainability.
