# Pagination

1. How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters:
You'll learn how to design endpoints that accept parameters such as page and page_size to paginate through a dataset efficiently. Implementing this feature involves understanding how to slice the dataset based on these parameters and return the appropriate subset of data.
2. How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata:
Hypermedia-driven pagination involves enriching paginated responses with hypermedia links that guide clients through the dataset. You'll learn how to include metadata in API responses, such as links to the next and previous pages, first and last pages, and additional context for navigating the dataset.
3. How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner:
Deletion-resilient pagination ensures consistent pagination results even when items are deleted from the dataset between paginated requests. You'll explore strategies for handling deletions gracefully, such as using cursor-based pagination or timestamp-based pagination to maintain pagination integrity.

## Implementation Guidelines
### Paginate a Dataset with Simple Parameters:
Design API endpoints that accept page and page_size parameters.
Implement pagination logic to slice the dataset based on these parameters.
Return the paginated subset of data along with metadata indicating the total number of items and current pagination context.
### Paginate a Dataset with Hypermedia Metadata:
Enhance paginated responses with hypermedia links to facilitate navigation.
Include links for the next and previous pages, first and last pages, and additional contextual links as needed.
Ensure that clients can discover and follow these links to navigate through the dataset seamlessly.
### Paginate in a Deletion-Resilient Manner:
Choose a pagination strategy that can handle deletions gracefully.
Consider using cursor-based pagination or timestamp-based pagination to maintain pagination consistency.
Test pagination functionality under scenarios involving dataset deletions to ensure robustness and reliability.
