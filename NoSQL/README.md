## General Understanding
### NoSQL Overview
NoSQL databases provide a flexible schema for storing and managing data, allowing for scalability and performance optimizations.

### Difference between SQL and NoSQL
SQL databases are relational and have a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer schema flexibility.

### ACID Properties
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensures the reliability of database transactions.

### Document Storage
NoSQL databases like MongoDB store data in document-oriented formats such as JSON or BSON.

### NoSQL Types
NoSQL databases include Key-Value stores, Document databases, Column-Family stores, and Graph databases, each serving different use cases.

### Benefits of NoSQL databases
Scalability, flexibility, performance, and schema-less design are among the key benefits of NoSQL databases.

## MongoDB
### MongoDB basics
MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

### CRUD Operations
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are fundamental to MongoDB for managing data.

### Querying information
MongoDB provides a powerful query language for retrieving specific data from collections.

### Insert/Update/Delete operations
MongoDB supports various methods for inserting, updating, and deleting documents.

### Aggregation
MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for complex data manipulation and analysis.

### mongo Shell Methods
The mongo shell provides various methods for interacting with MongoDB, facilitating administration and development tasks.

## Project Structure
### MongoDB Command File
A file containing MongoDB commands/scripts for setup and administration.

### Python Scripts
Scripts written in Python using PyMongo for interacting with MongoDB.

### README.md
This documentation file providing an overview of the project, its components, and usage instructions.

## Installation and Setup
### MongoDB Installation
Follow the official MongoDB installation guide for setting up MongoDB on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

### PyMongo Installation
