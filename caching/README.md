# Caching Algorithms in Web Dev

- In this project, we will delve into various caching algorithms commonly used in web development. Caching plays a crucial role in improving the performance and efficiency of web applications by storing frequently accessed data in temporary storage for faster retrieval.

## General
Understand what a caching system is and its significance in web development.
Define FIFO (First In, First Out) caching policy and its application in caching systems.
Explain LIFO (Last In, First Out) caching policy and its relevance in caching algorithms.
Describe LRU (Least Recently Used) caching policy and how it determines which cache entries to evict.
Discuss MRU (Most Recently Used) caching policy and its role in cache management.
Define LFU (Least Frequently Used) caching policy and its implementation in caching systems.
Recognize the purpose of a caching system in optimizing data access and application performance.
Identify the limitations of caching systems, including potential drawbacks and constraints.
