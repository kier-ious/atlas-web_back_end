# Python - Async Comprehension

Covering the concept of async comprehensions in Python, which allows for asynchronous iteration over collections. 

- An asynchronous generator in Python is created using the async def syntax and contains yield statements within asynchronous functions, allowing it to yield values asynchronously as they become available.

- Async comprehensions enable asynchronous iteration over collections, allowing for concise and efficient asynchronous data processing. They are constructed similarly to regular comprehensions but prefixed with async keyword.

- Type-annotating generators in Python involves using type hints to specify the types of values yielded by the generator function. This enhances code readability and helps catch type-related errors during development.
